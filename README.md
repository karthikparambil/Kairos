# **Kairos Clock \- Simple Guide**

## **1\. What is Kairos Clock?**

**Kairos Clock** is a cool, all-in-one time app for your computer. It looks modern (like frosted glass) and helps you keep track of time, set alarms, and organize your tasks.

It runs entirely in your web browser (like Chrome or Edge). You don't need to install anything or sign up for an account. It works right away\!

## **2\. What Can It Do?**

###  **Time Tools**

* **World Clock:** Shows you the exact time and date.  
* **Timer:** A countdown clock. You can pick quick times like 10 minutes or 1 hour.  
  * **Pomodoro Mode:** A special timer for studying or working. It sets a 25-minute timer for work, and then helps you take a break.  
* **Stopwatch:** A tool to count up time (like for sports or races). You can pause it and save "laps."  
* **Alarm:** Set a specific time for the clock to ring and wake you up or remind you of something.

###  **Planning Tools**

* **Calendar:** A view of the whole month. You can click on any day to see or add tasks. Dots on the calendar show you which days have things to do.  
* **Tasks (To-Do List):**  
  * **Daily Tasks:** Add chores or homework to specific days.  
  * **All Tasks View:** A list of everything coming up, so you don't forget anything.  
  * **Reminders:** You can tell the app to notify you at the exact time a task is due, or give you a heads-up 10, 20, or 30 minutes before.

###  **Fun Stuff**

* **Themes:** Change the colors of the app\! You can choose styles like **Cyberpunk** (neon colors), **Forest** (green), **Sunset** (orange/pink), or **Monochrome** (black and white).  
* **Sounds:** Pick different sounds for your alarms, like "Cosmic" (sci-fi), "Retro" (video game), or "Zen" (relaxing chimes).  
* **Full Screen:** Make the clock take up your whole monitor for a cool desk setup.

## **3\. How It Works (The Techy Part)**

* **One File:** The whole app is just one file (index.html). This means it's super fast and easy to share.  
* **Saves Your Data:** It remembers your alarms, tasks, and favorite colors using your browser's memory. If you close the tab and open it again, your stuff is still there\!  
* **No Internet Needed:** Once you have the file, you don't even need the internet to use it.

## **4\. How to Use It**

1. **Open It:** Just double-click the index.html file to open it in your browser.  
2. **Allow Notifications:** The first time you set a timer or alarm, the browser will ask if it can show notifications. Click **Allow** so you can see alerts even if you are looking at a different website.  
3. **Start Planning:** Click the buttons on the bottom to switch between the Clock, Timer, Stopwatch, and Calendar.

## **5\. Summary**

Kairos Clock is a simple, private, and stylish way to manage your time. It helps you stay focused on your work or homework without needing complicated software. Just open it up and start being productive\!
